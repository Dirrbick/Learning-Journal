## Day 2 of Code 102!

While working in the terminal I learned a few things.

1. The terminal is case sensitive.
       - When I typed ls $shell, it did not do anything, but when I typed ls $SHELL it ran /bin/bash
1. I learned that when you type man ls, it gives you a list of options for that command line.
1. The terminal is fixed with tab completion, it is like a smart text.
1. Working with the files options doesn't do much for my computer at the moment. 
       - Once I start getting more info on my laptop I will be able to work with the Files section.

### Basic Text Editor v.s. IDE

   - I learned that the difference between all the editors is that they are all different tools for a specific job. Most people stick with just one editor for all jobs when it would be more efficient to learn how to use multiple editors. It is like a Chef having a knife bag. There are many different knives for different jobs. I wouldn't use a filet knife to break down a ribeye. I could use it but it would take a lot longer than using the proper knife.

 | Basic Text Editor | IDE |
 | --- | --- |
 | Slim and fast | Powerful |
 | Has all Basic needs | Has a lot of features |
 | Used for smaller projects | Used on jobs with large CodeBase |
