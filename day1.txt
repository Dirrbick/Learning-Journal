* Hello! My name is Kory Jackson, I have been married for almost 4 years to my beautiful bride. We have 2 fur babies, a cat and dog. I have been a Professional Chef for the past 2 years and Cooking for 14 total years. Web developement has been an interest of mine for some time but I always felt I wouldn't be smart enough to do it. I'm going through this class to challenge myself and learn something new.

### Growth Mindset

   To me _Growth Mindset_ is about always being open to new learning oppurtunities. You can learn something new every day. I always like to say ***The smartest man in the world can still learn something new today***. You may have done the same task every day for 5 years, then someone could come in and show you a different way. If you are not open to changing your own mindset, then you will stop developing your own skills. We all start somewhere, it is what we do with that starting point that defines what the outcome will be.



3 reminders on Growth Mindset

1. Keep reminding myself of the workout method.
     - The strongest man in the world was once a twig.
2. Nothing is "Too Hard".
     - Everything is a New Challenge
3. There is no such thing as a mistake.
     - The lightbulb wasn't invented on the first try.


#### Learning Journal
I plan to take this learning journal with me and use it throughout my career. It is going to be the foundation for all of my future success!
