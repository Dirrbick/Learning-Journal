# Day 4 of 102!!
    I plan to get into html and learn as much as I can about the different styles of writing code

## Structure For Websites
- When writing a website, there needs to be a stucture so that the reader doesn't get confused.

## About Html
1. "Opening" and "closing" tags.
    - You can use `<p>` & `</p>`
    - The / is the closing tag
    - The tags describe what will happen inbetween
1. Attributes
    - They appear in the opening tag of the element
        - `<p lang="en-us">`
1. Body, Head & Title
    - `<body>`
        - Everything inside is shown on the main browser
    - `<head>`
        - Contains info about the page.
        - Usually contains the "title" of the page
    - `<title>`
        - Usually the title up on top of the browser/in the minimized tab

## Process & Design

    One of the main things you need to keep your eye on when writing a website, is that you are not writing it for you but for a certain "target" audience. If it doesn't appeal to those people, then they will not use it.
