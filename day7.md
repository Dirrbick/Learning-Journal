# Day 7 of Code 102!!

## Scripts
    1. Access content
        -You can access text from the HTML document i.e. `<h1>`
    1. Modify Content
        - You can add text after headings/lines in an HTML Doc
    1. React to Events
        - You can make JS react to a button being pressed or after a certain point of loading a page.
    1. Just like learning a recipe, there is a lot of terminology to learn about. When I first started cooking I had no idea what a julienne was. It is the same concept. Whether it is an easy script or complex, it is the same as a simple or complex dish.

## Script Design
    1. List out the tasks that need to take place on a FlowChart
    1. List the steps required to do job

## Key things to keep in mind

    1. Vocabulary of JS- the words that computers understand
    1. Syntax- How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.
    1. I need to learn to think like a computer, it thinks and solves things differently than we do.

## Expressions & Operators

### Two Types of Expressions
    1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
        - `var color = 'beige';`
    1. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
        - `var area = 3 * 2;`
### Expressions rely on Operators
    1. assignment operators
        -`color = 'beige';`
        -`area= 3 * 2;`
        -`greeting = 'hi ' + 'Molly';`
        -`buy = 3 > 5;`
        -`but = (5>3 && (2 < 4);`
